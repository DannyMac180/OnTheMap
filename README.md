# OnTheMap

The fourth app from Udacity's iOS Nanodegree, OnTheMap is an an app with a map that shows information posted by other students. The map contains pin that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user can add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL.

What did I learn while building this app?

- How to access networked data using Appleâ€™s URL loading framework
- How to authenticate a user using a network connection
- How to create user interfaces that are responsive, and communicate network activity
- How to use Core Location and the MapKit framework for to display annotated pins on a map
